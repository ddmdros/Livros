            <h1>This Week In Destiny - 10/09/2025</h1>
            <footer>Oct 9, 2025 - Destiny 2 Community Team</footer>

            <p>This Week in Destiny, we are delving into a bunker to unearth a long-forgotten Warmind facility. In other words, our latest Exotic Mission is live, and we really hope you are enjoying your time using the very cool new Axe to keep The Conductor's forces at bay.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Go play Heliostat!</li>
                <li>No Power reset in Renegades</li>
                <li>Update 9.1.5.1 reminder</li>
                <li>Trials of Osiris tomorrow</li>
                <li>Bungie Foundation at TwitchCon</li>
                <li>New Heliostat Bungie Rewards</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Heliostat is live!</h2>
            <p>How are you enjoying our latest Exotic Mission? Did you have a good time with your new Psion buddies that Caiatl sent to assist you? And how about Wolfsbane, our first ever Exotic Axe? The first ever of its kind, it's very strong and you can make it even stronger if you find all the secrets in the mission.</p>
            <p>Heliostat can be accessed through the Portal. Your first completion will be locked at Normal difficulty with fixed modifiers, and you will be rewarded with a Power bump for all fireteam members. After that, you can customize the experience and launch it from the Pinnacle Ops tab.</p>
            <p>During this first week, all of Wolfsbane's Intrinsics are available along with one of its Exotic catalysts. Starting next week, the remaining catalysts will be available for everyone to discover. Look carefully and you'll find all the secrets available!</p>

            <h2>Destiny 2: Renegates power reset update</h2>
            <p>In keeping with our commitment to hear and act on player feedback, we have some major changes to announce to how Seasonal Power will carry over at the beginning of Season 28 and the launch of Destiny 2: Renegades:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Seasonal Power will carry over from Season 27.</li>
                <ul><li>Tooltips will be updated to reflect the removal of the Seasonal Power reset.</li></ul>
                <li>Unstable Cores will carry over.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since this announcement, we have seen some general questions about the Power Cap and Unstable Core Economy.</p>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>We have no plans to raise the Power Cap at this time.</li>
                <ul><li>It will remain at 550 through Renegades.</li></ul>
                <li>Our next priority for Unstable Cores is to revisit the economy and address player feedback around this currency.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>We plan to have more details in a future TWID. Stay tuned!</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <p>In addition to this, we will be adding a Power catch-up in Update 9.1.5.1 on October 14 to give new and returning players a boost up to 300 Power. As a reminder, we're also introducing a number of important adjustments to activity rewards and Power climb in next week's update. Read on for a recap!</p>

            <h2>Portal and Progression Changes in Update 9.1.5.1</h2>
            <p>As we outlined late last month, Update 9.1.5.1 will include tuning adjustments to how players interact with and progress in the Portal. When this update goes live on October 14, this will include bumps to Power earned on rewards, reductions to the difficulty caps at higher difficulties, and the removal of activity Power increases when adding challenge modifiers to custom activities.

</p>

<p>Here is a selection of some of the imminent changes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Weâ€™re speeding up the Power climb with more Powerful drops in Solo Ops, Fireteam Ops, and Pinnacle Ops. Almost every activity grade for each Power range will see improved drops.
</li>
<li>The extra bonus engram rewards you get on top of your completion prizes will now have the same Power as the engrams from the end-of-activity chest.
</li>
<li>Power adjustment has been removed from all Challenge modifiers. Instead, players are capped in effective Power within each difficulty tier.
</li>
<ul>
    <li>Normal Difficulty Delta Cap: 0
</li>
<li>Advanced: -10
</li>
<li>Expert: -15
</li>
<li>Master: -20
</li>
<li>Grandmaster: -25</li>
<li>Ultimate: -30</li>
</ul>
<li>Players will no longer have difficulty tiers auto-selected for them until they meet the Power level of the activity.
</li>
<li>Since a vast majority of players will be at 300 Power or above going forward due to the catch-up chest, Normal, Advanced, and Expert Quickplay nodes have been removed, as has the Expert Matchmaking tier from direct launch, so that you can find people when you try to matchmake. The new node replacing these has been adjusted so that anyone from 10-399 can earn good rewards from it.
</li>
</ul>
